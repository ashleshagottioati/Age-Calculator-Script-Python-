Age Calculator Script (Python)
This Python script calculates a user's age in years, months, and days based on the age (in years) they provide. It uses the current system date to perform the calculations.

How It Works:
User Input: Prompts for the user's name and age in years.

Date Handling: Uses the time module to get the current date.

Leap Year Check: Uses calendar.isleap() to determine if a given year is a leap year.

Days Calculation:

Adds 365 or 366 days for each year based on leap year status.

Adds days for each month in the current year up to the present month.

Adds the current day of the month.

Output:
Displays the user's age in three formats:

Total years

Total months

Total days
